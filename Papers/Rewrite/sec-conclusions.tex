\section{Conclusions and future work}

We have defined a technique for eliminating redundant tests in
intermediate code.  The technique relies on replication of code paths
between two identical tests.  So far, our technique only defines a
\emph{mechanism} for achieving the result.  It does not yet define a
\emph{policy} stating when the technique should be applied.

The question of policy is an important one, because with a large
number of redundant tests in the intermediate code, there is a
possibility for \emph{exponential blowup} of the code size.
Future work involves defining a reasonable policy to avoid such
pathological cases.
