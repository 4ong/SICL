\section{Our technique}

Our technique consists of applying \emph{local graph rewriting} to the
graph of instructions in intermediate code.  Local graph rewriting has
the advantage of being simple, both to implement and when it comes to
proving correctness.

For the purpose of this paper, we assume that some initial phase has
determined that:

\begin{enumerate}
\item there are two instructions, $I_1$ and $I_2$, in the program that
  are identical tests,
\item the variable being tested is the same in $I_1$ and $I_2$,
\item $I_1$ dominates $I_2$, and
\item the variable being tested is not assigned to in any path from
  $I_1$ to $I_2$.
\end{enumerate}

In a real compiler, such a phase probably does not exist.  Some items
are simplified if the compiler translates the intermediate code to SSA
form \cite{Cytron:1989:EMC:75277.75280,
  Cytron:1991:ECS:115372.115320}, and some items can be tested during
the execution of our technique.
