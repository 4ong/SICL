\section{Our technique}

\subsection{General description}

Our technique consists of applying \emph{local graph rewriting} to the
graph of instructions in intermediate code.  Local graph rewriting has
the advantage of being simple, both to implement and when it comes to
proving correctness.

For the purpose of this paper, we assume that some initial phase has
determined that:

\begin{enumerate}
\item there are two instructions, $D$ and $I$, in the program that
  are identical tests,
\item the variable being tested is the same in $D$ and $I$,
\item $D$ dominates $I$, and
\item the variable being tested is not assigned to in any path from
  $D$ to $I$.
\end{enumerate}

In a real compiler, such a phase probably does not exist.  Some items
are simplified if the compiler translates the intermediate code to SSA
form \cite{Cytron:1989:EMC:75277.75280,
  Cytron:1991:ECS:115372.115320}, and some items can be tested during
the execution of our technique.

During the execution of our algorithm, the instruction $I$ will be
\emph{replicated}, so that it is part of some set $S$ in which every
replica remains dominated by $D$.

In our technique, we keep track of the outcome of the test in the
\emph{control arcs} of the graph of intermediate instructions.
We can think of this information as being represented as three
different \emph{colors}:

\begin{itemize}
\item An arc is \emph{black} if we have no information concerning the
  outcome of the test at that point in the program.
\item An arc is \emph{green} if the outcome of the test at that point in
  the program is known to be \emph{true}.
\item An arc is \emph{red} if the outcome of the test at that point in
  the program is known to be \emph{false}.
\end{itemize}

Initially, only the outgoing arcs of $D$ and $I$ have a color
other than black.

Our technique involves the repeated application of the first
applicable rewrite rule in the following list to some arbitrary
element of $S$, say $s$, that does not itself have a predecessor in
$S$:

\begin{enumerate}
\item If $s$ has no predecessors, then remove it from $S$.
\item If $s$ has a \emph{green} incoming arc, then change the head
  of that arc so that it refers to the successor of $s$ referred to
  by the \emph{green} outgoing arc of $s$.
\item If $s$ has a \emph{red} incoming arc, then change the head
  of that arc so that it refers to the successor of $s$ referred to
  by the \emph{red} outgoing arc of $s$.
\item If $s$ has $n>1$ predecessors, then replicate $s$ $n$ times;
  once for each predecessor.  Every replica is inserted into $S$.
  Colors of outgoing control arcs are preserved in the replicas.
\item Let $p$ be the (unique) predecessor of $s$.  Remove $p$ as a
  predecessor of $s$ so that existing immediate predecessors of $p$
  instead become immediate predecessors of $s$.  Insert a replica of
  $p$ in each outgoing control arc of $s$, preserving the color of
  each arc.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
Rewrite rules are applied until the set $S$ is empty.

\subsection{A simple example}

Let us see how our technique works on the example in
\refSec{sec-introduction}.  The initial situation is shown in
\refFig{fig-rewrite-1}.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\inputfig{fig-rewrite-1.pdf_t}
\end{center}
\caption{\label{fig-rewrite-1}
Initial instruction graph.}
\end{figure}

As \refFig{fig-rewrite-1} shows, the second \texttt{consp} is
dominated by the first, so it becomes the only member of the set $S$.
The last rewrite rule applies to the second \texttt{consp} so that the
\texttt{setq} is replicated as its successors.  Then the last rewrite
rule applies again resulting in the replication of the \texttt{call}.
The result of these two applications is shown in \refFig{fig-rewrite-2}.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\inputfig{fig-rewrite-2.pdf_t}
\end{center}
\caption{\label{fig-rewrite-2}
Result after two rewrites.}
\end{figure}

As we can see in \refFig{fig-rewrite-2}, the second \texttt{consp}
now has two predecessors, and both incoming arcs are black.
Therefore, rewrite rule number $4$ applies and the \texttt{consp} is
replicated.  As a result, $S$ now has two members.  The result of
applying this rule is shown in \refFig{fig-rewrite-3}.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\inputfig{fig-rewrite-3.pdf_t}
\end{center}
\caption{\label{fig-rewrite-3}
Result after replicating the test.}
\end{figure}

We now choose the leftmost replica of the second \texttt{consp} to
apply our rules to.  It has a single predecessor with a black incoming
control arc, so the last rewrite rule applies.  We replicate the
\texttt{setq} in both branches of the test, giving us the result shown
in \refFig{fig-rewrite-4}.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\inputfig{fig-rewrite-4.pdf_t}
\end{center}
\caption{\label{fig-rewrite-4}
Result after replicating \texttt{setq}.}
\end{figure}

In \refFig{fig-rewrite-4}, the last rewrite rule applies again, and we
replicate the \texttt{cons-car}, giving us the situation shown in in
\refFig{fig-rewrite-5}.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\inputfig{fig-rewrite-5.pdf_t}
\end{center}
\caption{\label{fig-rewrite-5}
Result after replicating \texttt{cons-car}.}
\end{figure}

As \refFig{fig-rewrite-5} shows, the \texttt{consp} instruction now
has a single predecessor, but the incoming arc has a known outcome of
the test, namely \textit{true} (color green).  therefore, rewrite rule
number $2$ applies.  The left outgoing arc of the first \texttt{consp}
is redirected to go directly to the \texttt{cons-car} instruction.
The result of applying this rule is shown in \refFig{fig-rewrite-6}.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\inputfig{fig-rewrite-6.pdf_t}
\end{center}
\caption{\label{fig-rewrite-6}
Result after short-circuit \texttt{consp}.}
\end{figure}

At this point, the \texttt{consp} that we have been processing has no
predecessor so it is removed from $S$.  Removing all instructions that
can not be reached from the start instruction gives the situation
shown in \refFig{fig-rewrite-7}.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\inputfig{fig-rewrite-7.pdf_t}
\end{center}
\caption{\label{fig-rewrite-7}
Result after removing unreachable instructions.}
\end{figure}

Analyzing \refFig{fig-rewrite-7}, we can see that if the result of the
first \texttt{consp} yields \emph{true}, then no second test is
performed.  Instead, the variable \texttt{a} is set to the result of
the instruction \texttt{cons-car}, the variable \texttt{b} is set to
the result of the call, and the variable \texttt{c} is set to the
result of the instruction \texttt{cons-cdr}.  Applying the same rules
to the remaining \texttt{consp} instruction in $S$ and then to the
second \texttt{null} instruction (which is now dominated by the
first), yields the final result shown in  \refFig{fig-rewrite-8}.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\inputfig{fig-rewrite-8.pdf_t}
\end{center}
\caption{\label{fig-rewrite-8}
Final result.}
\end{figure}

This example represents a control graph that is particularly simple in
that there are no loops between the first and the second
\texttt{consp} instructions.  Our technique must obviously work no
matter the complexity of the control graph, as long as the first test
dominates the second.
