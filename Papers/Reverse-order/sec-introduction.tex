\section{Introduction}

The \commonlisp{} \emph{sequence} functions are defined to work on
lists as well as vectors.  Furthermore, many of these sequence
functions accept a keyword argument \texttt{from-end} that alters the
behavior in that elements toward the end of the sequence are favored
over elements toward the beginning of the sequence.

Most sequence functions are not required to process the elements from
the end of the sequence.  For example, it is allowed for \texttt{find}
to compare elements from the beginning of the sequence and return the
\emph{last} element that \emph{satisfies the test}%
\footnote{The phrase \emph{satisfy the test} has a precise meaning in
  the \commonlisp{} standard as shown in section 17.2 in that
  document.}
even if the test has side effects.  There is one exception this
requirement, however:  The \texttt{count} function is required by the
standard to test the elements from the end of the sequence.  Though if
the test has no side effects and cannot fail, as is the case of
functions such as \texttt{eq} or \texttt{eql}, testing from the
beginning is arguably conforming behavior.
