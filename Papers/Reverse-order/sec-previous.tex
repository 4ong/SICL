\section{Previous work}

We will frequently refer to techniques used by \sbcl{} because of its
reputation as a high-performance implementation.  We will however also
use other high-performance implementations for comparison when we have
information on the techniques used by those implementations, or when
we can reasonably guess these techniques from other evidence.

For its implementation of \texttt{find}, \sbcl{} takes advantage of
the freedom given by the standard, by processing elements from the
beginning, and remembering the last element that satisfies the test.
For implementations where the technique is unknown, it suffices to
write a test function that counts the number of times it is invoked
and run it on a list where only the last element satisfies the test.

For its implementation of \texttt{count}, \sbcl{} uses the simple
technique of reversing the list first and then processing the elements
of the reversed list from the beginning.

To test the stack depth of various implementations, we devised the
following test:

\begin{verbatim}
(defun stack-depth (n)
  (declare (optimize (space 3)))
  (if (zerop n) 0 (1+ (stack-depth (1- n)))))
\end{verbatim}

The following table shows approximate values of the argument to
\texttt{stack-depth} for which some implementations exhaust the stack:

\begin{tabular}{|l|r|}
\hline
Implementation & argument\\
\hline
\hline
\sbcl{} & 90000\\
\hline
Allegro & ???\\
\hline
LispWork & ???\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
