\subsection{Haddon and Waite}

In 1967, Haddon and Waite \cite{Haddon:1967} designed the first
algorithm for compacting garbage collection.  The context of their
work was assumed to be an existing mark-and-sweep garbage collector
using a free list, and when that collector fails due to fragmentation,
even though there is enough total space available, their compacting
algorithm would take over and compact the heap.  The cost of their
algorithm was considered unimportant, because the alternative would be
to fail by terminating the program.

Rather than invoking a marking procedure to determine live data, they
imagined using the existing free list to determine areas of available
storage. 

\subsection{Other work}

Cohen and Nocolau \cite{Cohen:1983:CCA:69575.357226} compared several
compacting collection techniques.
