\section{Previous work}

In their article [], Costanza and Herzeel give a simple example of
this simple \texttt{defmethod} form:

\begin{verbatim}
(defmethod foo ((x integer) (y integer))
  (do-something x y))
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
and at the end of section 2.1, on page 3, they claim that the
expansion of that form is ``something like'' the follow form:

{\small\begin{verbatim}
(let ((gf (ensure-generic-function 'foo)))
  (multiple-value-bind
      (lambda-expression extra-initargs)
      (make-method-lambda
        gf
        (class-prototype
          (generic-function-method-class gf))
        '(lambda (x y) (do-something x y))
        lexical-environment-of-defmethod-form)
    (add-method
      gf
      (apply #'make-instance
             (generic-function-method-class gf)
             :qualifiers '()
             :lambda-list '(x y)
             :specializers (list (find-class 'integer)
                                 (find-class 'integer))
             :function (compile nil lambda-expression)
             extra-initargs))
\end{verbatim}}

\noindent
except that we have formatted the code to fit the page, and we have
added two missing closing parentheses at the end of the form.
