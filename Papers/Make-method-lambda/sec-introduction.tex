\section{Introduction}

In the definition of the \commonlisp{} \cite{ansi:common:lisp}
metaobject protocol \cite{Kiczales:1991:AMP:574212}, the generic
function \texttt{make-method-lambda} plays a role that is very
different from most of the other generic functions that are part of
the metaobject protocol.

According to the book, the function has four parameters, all required:

\begin{enumerate}
\item A generic function metaobject.
\item A (possibly uninitialized) method metaobject.
\item A lambda expression.
\item An environment object.
\end{enumerate}

The main difference is that \texttt{make-method-lambda} is called as
part of the expansion code for the \texttt{defmethod} macro, whereas
other generic functions are called at execution time.
