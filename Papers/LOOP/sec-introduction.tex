\section{Introduction}
\label{sec-introduction}

The \texttt{loop} macro is part of the \commonlisp{} standard, so
every conforming \commonlisp{} implementation contains an
implementation of this macro. 

This macro is frequently criticized as un-Lispy since it does not use
S-expressions for its clauses, and for being impossible to extend, at
least by using only features available in the \commonlisp{} standard.
In addition, advocates of purely-functional programming also criticize
it, along with all other iteration constructs that can not be
explained in terms of recursion.

Despite all this criticism, the \texttt{loop} macro is an essential
and widely-used part of any non-trivial \commonlisp{} program.  It is
able to satisfy the vast majority of iteration needs.  In addition, it
is far easier to understand than equivalent loops using other
iteration constructs such as \texttt{dotimes}, \texttt{dolist}, and
\texttt{do}.
