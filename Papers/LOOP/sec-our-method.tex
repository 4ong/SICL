\section{Our technique}

In order to parse \texttt{loop} clauses We use a simplified version%
\footnote{It is simplified because we do not need the full
  backtracking power of combinator parsing.}
of a parsing technique known as \emph{combinator parsing}
\cite{Wadler:1985:RFL:5280.5288}.

With this parsing technique, client code defines \emph{elementary
  parsers} that are then combined using combinators such as
\emph{alternative} and \emph{sequence}.  The resulting parser code is
\emph{modular} in that individual parsers do not have to be listed in
one single place.  For the \texttt{loop} clauses, this modularity
means that each type of clause can be defined in a different module.
