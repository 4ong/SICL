\section{Our technique}

The technique described in this paper was developed as part of
\sicl{}.%
\footnote{The \sicl{} repository is public, and it is currently
  located at https://github.com/robert-strandh/SICL.}  The system is
written entirely in \cl{} and it was designed to be bootstrapped 
from a conforming \cl{} implementation including \clos{}.  

A generic function in \sicl{} contains a \emph{call history} which
associates classes of required arguments with corresponding effective
methods, and specifically allowed by the AMOP.  The discriminating
function of every standard generic function contains two parts: one
part computed from the call history and a second \emph{default} part,
invoked when the first part fails.  This second part of the
discriminating function invokes the complete machinery defined by
\texttt{compute-applicable-methods-using-classes},
\texttt{compute-applicable-methods}, and
\texttt{compute-effective-method}.
