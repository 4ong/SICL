\section{Previous work}

The AMOP \cite{Kiczales:1991:AMP:574212} contains a section entitled
``Living with Circularity'', which describes the essential nature of
the two kinds of issues discussed here, namely \emph{bootstrapping
  issues} and \emph{metastability issues}.  This section does not
contain a complete list of all possible issues in any implementation
of \clos{}, and probably could not contain such a list, since it would
depend on the exact organization of each particular implementation.

The section in the AMOP has two subsections, one for bootstrapping
issues and one for metastability issues.  The subsection on
bootstrapping issues is more complete.  

\subsection{Bootstrapping issues}

The section on bootstrapping issues contains two explicit issues.

The first one involves the class \texttt{standard-class} which is the
metaclass of all standard classes, including itself.  The authors
simply suggest creating this class manually.

The second issue involves the fact that generic function are required
in order to create classes, but during bootstrapping, there are no
generic functions since generic functions are instances of classes.
The technique used to handle such issues is to define ordinary
functions to contain code for essential methods, so that such
functions can be called during bootstrapping.  To avoid code
duplication, the methods defined later in the bootstrapping process
simply call those functions.  

\subsection{Metastability issues} 

The section on metastability issues also contains two issues.

The first issue involves the function \texttt{slot-value}.
