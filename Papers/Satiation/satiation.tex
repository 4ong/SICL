\begin{abstract}
The fact that \clos{} is defined as a \clos{} program introduces two
categories of issues that must be addressed, namely
\emph{bootstrapping issues} and \emph{metastability issues}
\cite{Kiczales:1991:AMP:574212}.  Of the two, the latter is the most
difficult one, and also the one that has the most negative impact on
the \emph{elegance} of the code, in that it requires base cases to be
handled specially.

We describe \emph{satiation}, a method by which metastability issues
can be turned into bootstrapping issues, thereby simplifying them and
keeping the code elegant.  Satiation consists of pre-loading the call
history of a generic function with respect to a set of argument
classes so that the base cases are handled without invoking the full
protocol for computing the effective methods at runtime.
