\section{Conclusions and future work}

Currently, nothing prevents a specified method on a specified generic
function, specializing on specified classes to be modified or removed,
and nothing prevents a specified class from being redefined.  Should
this happen, the system will crash.  We imagine a mechanism that
protects the user from inadvertently invoking such operations.  It
should probably be possible to \emph{toggle} the mechanism so that
system code can make modifications know to be safe.
