\section{Benefits of our method}
 
\subsection{Cross compilation}

\subsection{Native compilation}

The \commonlisp{} standards suggests that the \emph{startup
  environment} and the \emph{evaluation environment} may be
different.%
\footnote{Recall that the startup environment is the global
environment as it was when the compilation was initiated, and that the
evaluation environment is the global environment in which evaluations
initiated by the compiler are accomplished.}
Our method allows most evaluations by the compiler to have no
influence in the startup environment.  It suffices to \emph{clone} the
startup environment in order to obtains the evaluation environment. 

With the method described in the previous section, some evaluations
by the compiler would have side effects in the startup environment.
In particular, the value cells and function cells are shared.
Therefore, executing code at compile time that alters the global
binding of a function or a variable will also be seen in the startup
environment.
