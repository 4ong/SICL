\section{Protocol}

In this appendix, we describe the macros and functions that are part
of the protocol of our technique, used for implementing most of the
sequence functions.

\Defun {apply-key-function} {element key-function}

This function takes an element of the sequence and a function to apply
in order to obtain the object to use for comparison.  For performance
reasons, this function should be inlined.

A typical definition of this function might look like this:

{\small\begin{verbatim}
(defun apply-key-function (element key-function)
  (declare (optimize (speed 3) (debug 0) (safety 3)))
  (declare (type function key-function))
  (cond ((eq key-function #'identity)
	 element)
	((eq key-function #'car)
	 (car element))
	((eq key-function #'cdr)
	 (cdr element))
	(t
	 (funcall key-function element))))
\end{verbatim}}
