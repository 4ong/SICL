\section{Optimizations}

Inferred type information can be used to remove runtime type
discrimination (typeq instructions, as described in \refSec{sec-hir}
from the code. If the type of an input to typeq is inferred, it could
be that only one branch of the typeq is ever taken, and thus the typeq
itself can be removed.
