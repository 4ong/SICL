\subsection{The Nimble type inferencer}

Henry Baker describes the Nimble type inferencer5
\footnote{Unpublished technical report.  See for instance
  http://www.pipeline.com/~hbaker1/TInference.html.}  His technique
works for the pre-standard \commonlisp{} language, and works by
annotating source code with type information in the form of
\emph{type declarations}.

The advantage of Baker's technique is that it can be used with any
conforming \commonlisp{} implementation, except that it would need some
minor work in order to be applicable to code in the standardized
language.

\subsection{\sbcl{}}

The \sbcl{} implementation of \commonlisp{} is known to have excellent
type-inference capabilities. Its ``constraint propagation'' algorithm
is similar to that described here, but instead operates at control-flow
level of basic blocks, and can propagate constraints other than types.
Rather than inlining, \sbcl{} relies on
