\section{Our method}

A SICL object is either an \emph{immediate object} or a \emph{heap
  object}.  A heap object is either a \texttt{cons} cell or a
\emph{general instance}.  General instances and cons cells have unique
\emph{tags}.  Every general instance is represented by its
\emph{header}.  The header contains two pointers, one to the
\emph{class} of the instance and one to the \emph{rack} of the
instance.  The pointer to the class is a tagged pointer to another
general instance.  The pointer to the rack is a raw machine pointer.  
This representation is shown in \refFig{fig-general-instance}.
