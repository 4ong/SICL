\section{Conclusions and future work}

We have presented a fast method for generic dispatch in \cl{}.
Clearly, our tests do not represent any scientifically convincing
argument that our method is faster than that of PCL.  Rather, the
presentation of the method itself should be considered essence of the
paper, and the performance simulations should only be viewed as
indications that our method is worth pursuing as the bases of the
generic dispatch mechanism in SICL. 

Having said that, we can still speculate about the impact of our
method, should the results be confirmed in a more realistic setting. 

Talk about print-object and other special cases.

Talk about the future of SICL.
