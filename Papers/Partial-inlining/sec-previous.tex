Ayers et al \cite{Ayers:1997:AI:258915.258928} consider the benefit of
inlining consisting of the elimination of the overhead of a procedure
call to be a ``side benefit'', and we agree.  They cite the main
benefit as the opportunity for more optimizing code transformations
when the code of the called function is exposed in the context of the
calling function.
