\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Inlining is an important optimization technique in any modern
compiler, though the description of this technique in the literature
is informal and vague.  We describe a technique for inlining designed
to work on a \emph{flow graph} of instructions of intermediate code.

Our technique uses \emph{local graph rewriting}, making the semantic
correctness of this technique obvious.  In addition, we prove
that the algorithm terminates.

As a direct result of the preservation of the semantics of the program
after each local rewriting step, the algorithm can stop after any
iteration, resulting in the \emph{partial inlining} of the called
function.  Such partial inlining can be advantageous in order to avoid
the inlining of code that is not performance critical, in particular
for creating arguments and calls to error-signaling functions.
