\section{Our technique}

In our compiler, source code is first converted to an \emph{abstract
  syntax tree}.  In such a tree, lexical variables and lexical
function names have been converted to unique objects.  When a globally
defined function $F$ is inlined into another function $G$, we simply
incorporate the abstract syntax tree of $F$ as if it were a local
function in $G$.  No alpha renaming is required.
