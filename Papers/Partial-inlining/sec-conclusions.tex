\section{Conclusions and future work}
\label{sec-conclusions}

We have defined a technique for inlining local functions that uses
local graph rewriting techniques.  We have proved our technique to be
correct in that it preserves the semantics of the original program,
and it is guaranteed to terminate.

Although our iterative technique can be stopped at any point, thus
giving us \emph{partial inlining}, there are some practical aspects of
such partial inlining that still need to be investigated:

\begin{itemize}
\item When the inlining is not complete, the called function has
  multiple entry points.  Many optimization techniques described in
  the literature assume that a function has a single entry point.  We
  plan to investigate the consequences of such multiple entry points
  on the optimization techniques that we have already implemented, as
  well as on any optimization techniques described in the literature
  and that we plan to incorporate.
\item In our intermediate code, we treat multiple values with an
  unknown number of values as a special type of datum.  During the
  execution of our inlining procedure, such a datum may become part of
  the mapping between variables of the called function and the calling
  function.  When the inlining procedure continues until termination,
  such a datum will be handled in the calling function in the same way
  that it is handled in the called function.  However, if the inlining
  procedure is stopped with such a datum in the mapping, we would
  somehow need to transmit it as an argument to the called function.
  Doing so may require costly allocation of temporary memory and
  costly tests for the number of values that would not be required
  when the procedure continues until termination.
\end{itemize}
