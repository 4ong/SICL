\section{Introduction}

Inlining represents an important optimization technique in any modern
compiler.  It avoids the overhead of a full function call, and it
allows further optimization in the calling function, such as type
inference.

However, inlining does not have only advantages.  It increases the
size of the code, with a possible negative impact on processor cache
performance.  It also increases pressure on register allocation,
possibly making it necessary to spill registers to the stack more
often.
