\subsection{SBCL}

The \sbcl{} \commonlisp{} implementation unsurprisingly defines the
class \texttt{method-combination} and then the class
\texttt{standard-method-combination} as a subclass of
\texttt{method-combination}.

More surprisingly, it then defines two subclasses of
\texttt{standard-method-combination}, namely
\texttt{long-method-combination} and
\texttt{short-method-combination}, each for use with the different
forms (long and short) of the macro
\texttt{define-method-combination}.
