\section{Our technique}

A binding of a function name to a function object contains an
indirection in the form of a \emph{function cell}.  The same holds for
the binding of a variable name (a symbol) to its \emph{global value}.
In our implementation, these cells are ordinary \texttt{cons} cells
with the \texttt{car} containing the value of the binding, and the
\texttt{cdr} contains \texttt{nil}.
