\section{Previous work}

The idea of first-class environments is of course not new.
Gelernter et al \cite{Gelernter:1987:EFC:41625.41634} defined a
language called ``Symmetric Lisp'' in which the programmer is allowed
to evaluate expressions with respect to a particular first-class
environment.  They suggest using this kind of environment as a
replacement for a variety of constructs, including closures,
structures, classes, and modules.  The present paper does not have
this kind of ambitious objective, simply because we do not know how to
obtain excellent performance for all these constructs with our
suggested protocol.

Queinnec and de Roure \cite{Queinnec:1996:SCT:232627.232653} proposed
a protocol for first-class environments in the context of the
\scheme{} programming language.  Their motivation is different from
ours, in that their environments are meant to be part of the
user-visible interface so as to simplify sharing of various objects.
However, like the present work, they are also concerned with
performance, and they show how to implement their protocol without
serious performance degradation.
