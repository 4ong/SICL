\section{Previous work}

\subsection{Gelernter et al}

The idea of first-class environments is of course not new.
Gelernter et al \cite{Gelernter:1987:EFC:41625.41634} defined a
language called ``Symmetric Lisp'' in which the programmer is allowed
to evaluate expressions with respect to a particular first-class
environment.  They suggest using this kind of environment as a
replacement for a variety of constructs, including closures,
structures, classes, and modules.  The present paper does not have
this kind of ambitious objective, simply because we do not know how to
obtain excellent performance for all these constructs with our
suggested protocol.

\subsection{Queinnec and Roure}

Queinnec and de Roure \cite{Queinnec:1996:SCT:232627.232653} proposed
a protocol for first-class environments in the context of the
\scheme{} programming language.  Their motivation is different from
ours, in that their environments are meant to be part of the
user-visible interface so as to simplify sharing of various objects.
However, like the present work, they are also concerned with
performance, and they show how to implement their protocol without
serious performance degradation.

\subsection{Garret's lexicons}

Ron Garret desicribes \emph{lexicons}%
\footnote{Unpublished document.  A PDF version can be found here:
  http://www.flownet.com/ron/lisp/lexicons.pdf.}
which are said to be first-class global environments.  However, the
concept of a lexicon is very different from the concept of a
first-class global environment as defined in this paper.

For one thing, a lexicon is ``a mapping from symbols to bindings'',
which excludes a per-environment set of packages, simply because
package names are not symbols, but strings.

Furthermore, a clearly stated goal of lexicons is to create a
different \lisp{} dialect targeted to new users or to users that have
prior experience with languages that are different from \lisp{}.

One similarity between lexicons and the first-class environments
presented in this paper is that \emph{symbols} are still unique, i.e.,
for a given package $P$ and a given symbol name $N$, there is at most
one symbol with the name $N$ in $P$; independently of the number of
lexicons or first-class environments in the system.
