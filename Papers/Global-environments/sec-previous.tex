\section{Previous work}

The idea of first-class environments is of course not new.
Gelernter et al \cite{Gelernter:1987:EFC:41625.41634} ...

Queinnec and de Roure \cite{Queinnec:1996:SCT:232627.232653} proposed
a protocol for first-class environments in the context of the
\scheme{} programming language.  Their motivation is different from
ours, in that their environments are meant to be part of the
user-visible interface so as to simplify sharing of various objects.
However, like the present work, they are also concerned with
performance, and they show how to implement their protocol without
serious performance degradation.
