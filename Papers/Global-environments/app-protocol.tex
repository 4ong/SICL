\Defgeneric {fboundp} {fname env}

This generic function is a generic version of the \commonlisp{}
function \texttt{cl:fboundp}. 

It returns true if \textit{fname} has a definition in
\textit{env} as an ordinary function, a generic function, a
macro, or a special operator.

\Defgeneric {fmakunbound} {fname env}

This generic function is a generic version of the \commonlisp{}
function \texttt{cl:fmakunbound}.

Makes \textit{fname} unbound in the function namespace of
\textit{env}.

If \textit{fname} already has a definition in
\textit{env} as an ordinary function, as a generic function,
as a macro, or as a special operator, then that definition is lost.

If \textit{fname} has a \texttt{setf} expander associated with
it, then that \texttt{setf} expander is lost.

\Defgeneric {special-operator} {fname env}

if \textit{fname} has a definition as a special operator in
\textit{env}, then that definition is returned.  The definition is an
the object that was used as an argument to \texttt{(setf
  special-operator)}.  The exact nature of this object is not
specified, other than that it can not be \texttt{nil}.  If
\textit{fname} does not have a definition as a special operator in
\textit{env}, then \texttt{nil} is returned.

\Defgeneric {(setf special-operator)} {new-def fname env}

Set the definition of \textit{fname} to be a special operator.  The
exact nature of \textit{new-def} is not specified, except that a value
of \texttt{nil} means that \textit{fname} no longer has a definition
as a special operator in \textit{env}.

If a value other than \texttt{nil} is given for \textit{new-def}, and
\textit{fname} already has a definition as an ordinary function, as a
generic function, or as a macro, then an error is signaled.  As a
consequence, if it is desirable for \textit{fname} to have a
definition both as a special operator and as a macro, then the
definition as a special operator should be set first.

\Defgeneric {fdefinition} {fname env}

This generic function is a generic version of the \commonlisp{}
function \texttt{cl:fdefinition}. 

If \textit{fname} has a definition in the function namespece of
\textit{env} (i.e., if \texttt{fboundp} returns true), then a call to
this function succeeds.  Otherwise an error of type
\texttt{undefined-function} is signaled.

If \textit{fname} is defined as an ordinary function or a generic
function, then a call to this function returns the associated
function object.

If \textit{fname} is defined as a macro, then a list of the form
\texttt{(cl:macro-function \textrm{\textit{function}})} is returned, where
\textit{function} is the macro expansion function associated with the
macro.

If \textit{fname} is defined as a special operator, then a list of the
form \texttt{(cl:special \textrm{\textit{object}})} is returned, where
  the nature of \textit{object} is currently not specified.

\Defgeneric {(setf fdefinition)} {new-def fname env}

This generic function is a generic version of the \commonlisp{}
function \texttt{cl:fdefinition}. 

\textit{new-def} must be a function.  If \textit{fname} already names
a function or a macro, then the previous definition is lost.  If
\textit{fname} already names a special operator, then an error is
signaled.

If \textit{fname} is a symbol and it has an associated \texttt{setf}
expander, then that \texttt{setf} expander is preserved.

\Defgeneric {macro-function} {symbol env}

This generic function is a generic version of the \commonlisp{}
function \texttt{cl:macro-function}.

If \textit{symbol} has a definition as a macro in \textit{env}, then the
corresponding macro expansion function is returned.

If \textit{symbol} has no definition in the function namespace of
\textit{env}, or if the definition is not a macro, then this
function returns \texttt{nil}.


\Defgeneric {(setf macro-function)} {new-def symbol env}

This generic function is a generic version of the \commonlisp{}
function \texttt{(setf cl:macro-function)}.

\textit{new-def} must be a macro expansion function or \texttt{nil}.
A call to this function then always succeeds.  A value of \texttt{nil}
means that the \textit{symbol} no longer has a macro function
associated with it.  If \textit{symbol} already names a macro or a
function, then the previous definition is lost.  If \textit{symbol}
already names a special operator, that definition is kept.

If \textit{symbol} already names a function, then any proclamation of
the type of that function is lost.  In other words, if at some later
point \textit{symbol} is again defined as a function, its proclaimed
type will be T.

If \textit{symbol} already names a function, then any \texttt{inline} or
\texttt{notinline} proclamation of the type of that function is lost.  In other
words, if at some later point \textit{symbol} is again defined as a
function, its proclaimed inline information will be \texttt{nil}.

If \textit{fname} is a symbol and it has an associated \texttt{setf}
expander, then that \texttt{setf} expander is preserved.

\Defgeneric {compiler-macro-function} {fname env}

This generic function is a generic version of the \commonlisp{}
function \texttt{cl:compiler-macro-function}.

If \textit{fname} has a definition as a compiler macro in
\textit{env}, then the corresponding compiler macro function is
returned.

If \textit{fname} has no definition as a compiler macro in
\textit{env}, then this function returns \texttt{nil}.

\Defgeneric {(setf compiler-macro-function)} {new-def fname env}

This generic function is a generic version of the \commonlisp{}
function \texttt{(setf cl:compiler-macro-function)}.

\textit{new-def} can be a compiler macro function or \texttt{nil}.
When it is a compiler macro function, then it establishes
\textit{new-def} as a compiler macro for \textit{fname} and any
existing definition is lost.  A value of \texttt{nil} means that
\textit{fname} no longer has a compiler macro associated with it in
\textit{env}.

\Defgeneric {function-type} {fname env}

This generic function returns the proclaimed type of the function
associated with \textit{fname} in \textit{env}.

If \textit{fname} is not associated with an ordinary function or a
generic function in \textit{env}, then an error is signaled.  

If \textit{fname} is associated with an ordinary function or a
generic function in \textit{env}, but no type proclamation for that
function has been made, then this generic function returns T.

\Defgeneric {(setf function-type)} {new-type fname env}

This generic function is used to set the proclaimed type of the
function associated with \textit{fname} in \textit{env} to NEW-TYPE.

If \textit{fname} is associated with a macro or a special operator
in \textit{env}, then an error is signaled.

\Defgeneric {function-inline} {fname env}

This generic function returns the proclaimed inline information of
the function associated with \textit{fname} in \textit{env}.

If \textit{fname} is not associated with an ordinary function or a
generic function in \textit{env}, then an error is signaled.

If \textit{fname} is associated with an ordinary function or a
generic function in \textit{env}, then the return value of this
function is either \texttt{nil}, \texttt{inline}, or \texttt{notinline}.  If no inline
proclamation has been made, then this generic function returns
\texttt{nil}.

\Defgeneric {(setf function-inline)} {new-inline fname env}

This generic function is used to set the proclaimed inline
information of the function associated with \textit{fname} in
\textit{env} to \textit{new-inline}.

\textit{new-inline} must have one of the values \texttt{nil}, \texttt{inline}, or
\texttt{notinline}.

If \textit{fname} is not associated with an ordinary function or a
generic function in \textit{env}, then an error is signaled.

\Defgeneric {function-cell} {fname env}

A call to this function always succeeds.  It returns a CONS cell,
in which the CAR always holds the current definition of the
function named \textit{fname}.  When \textit{fname} has no
definition as a function, the CAR of this cell will contain a
function that, when called, signals an error of type
\texttt{undefined-function}.  The return value of this function is always
the same (in the sense of EQ) when it is passed the same (in the
sense of EQUAL) function name and the same (in the sense of EQ)
environment.

\Defgeneric {function-unbound} {fname env}

A call to this function always succeeds.  It returns a function
that, when called, signals an error of type \texttt{undefined-function}.
When \textit{fname} has no definition as a function, the return
value of this function is the contents of the CONS cell returned
by FUNCTION-CELL.  The return value of this function is always the
same (in the sense of EQ) when it is passed the same (in the sense
of EQUAL) function name and the same (in the sense of EQ)
environment.  Client code can use the return value of this
function to determine whether \textit{fname} is unbound and if so
signal an error when an attempt is made to evaluate the form
(FUNCTION \textit{fname}).

\Defgeneric {function-lambda-list} {fname env}

This function returns two values.  The first value is an ordinary
lambda list, or \texttt{nil} if no lambda list has been defined for
\textit{fname}.  The second value is true if and only if a lambda
list has been defined for \textit{fname}.

\Defgeneric {boundp} {symbol env}

It returns true if \textit{symbol} has a definition in \textit{env} as a
constant variable, as a special variable, or as a symbol macro.
Otherwise, it returns false.

\Defgeneric {constant-variable} {symbol env}

This function is used in order to define \textit{symbol} as a constant
variable in \textit{env}, with \textit{value} as its value.

If \textit{symbol} already has a definition as a special variable or as a
symbol macro in \textit{env}, then an error is signaled.

If \textit{symbol} already has a definition as a constant variable, and its
current value is not EQL to \textit{value}, then an error is signaled.

\Defgeneric {(setf constant-variable)} {value symbol env}

This function is used in order to define \textit{symbol} as a constant
variable in \textit{env}, with \textit{value} as its value.

If \textit{symbol} already has a definition as a special variable or as a
symbol macro in \textit{env}, then an error is signaled.

If \textit{symbol} already has a definition as a constant variable, and its
current value is not EQL to \textit{value}, then an error is signaled.

\Defgeneric {special-variable} {symbol env}

This function returns two values.  The first value is the value of
\textit{symbol} as a special variable in \textit{env}, or NIL if \textit{symbol}
does not have a value as a special variable in \textit{env}.  The
second value is true if \textit{symbol} does have a value as a special
variable in \textit{env} and false otherwise.

Notice that the symbol can have a value even though this function
returns NIL and NIL.  The first such case is when the symbol has a
value as a constant variable in \textit{env}.  The second case is when
the symbol was assigned a value using \texttt{(setf symbol-value)}
without declaring the variable as SPECIAL.

\Defgeneric {(setf special-variable)} {value symbol env init-p}

This function is used in order to define \textit{symbol} as a special
variable in \textit{env}.

If \textit{symbol} already has a definition as a constant variable or as a
symbol macro in \textit{env}, then an error is signaled.
Otherwise, \textit{symbol} is defined as a special variable in \textit{env}.

If \textit{symbol} already has a definition as a special variable, and
\textit{init-p} is false, then this function has no effect.  The
current value is not altered, or if \textit{symbol} is currently
unbound, then it remains unbound.

If \textit{init-p} is true, then \textit{value} becomes the new
value of the special variable \textit{symbol}.
