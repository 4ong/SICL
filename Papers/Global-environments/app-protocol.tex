\Defgeneric {fboundp} {fname env}

This generic function is a generic version of the \commonlisp{}
function \texttt{cl:fboundp}. 

It returns true if \textit{fname} has a definition in
\textit{env} as an ordinary function, a generic function, a
macro, or a special operator.

\Defgeneric {fmakunbound} {fname env}

This generic function is a generic version of the \commonlisp{}
function \texttt{cl:fmakunbound}.

Makes \textit{fname} unbound in the function namespace of
\textit{env}.

If \textit{fname} already has a definition in
\textit{env} as an ordinary function, as a generic function,
as a macro, or as a special operator, then that definition is lost.

If \textit{fname} has a \texttt{setf} expander associated with
it, then that \texttt{setf} expander is lost.

\Defgeneric {special-operator} {fname env}

if \textit{fname} has a definition as a special operator in
\textit{env}, then that definition is returned.  The definition is an
the object that was used as an argument to \texttt{(setf
  special-operator)}.  The exact nature of this object is not
specified, other than that it can not be \texttt{nil}.  If
\textit{fname} does not have a definition as a special operator in
\textit{env}, then \texttt{nil} is returned.

\Defgeneric {(setf special-operator)} {new-def fname env}

Set the definition of \textit{fname} to be a special operator.  The
exact nature of \textit{new-def} is not specified, except that a value
of \texttt{nil} means that \textit{fname} no longer has a definition
as a special operator in \textit{env}.

If a value other than \texttt{nil} is given for \textit{new-def}, and
\textit{fname} already has a definition as an ordinary function, as a
generic function, or as a macro, then an error is signaled.  As a
consequence, if it is desirable for \textit{fname} to have a
definition both as a special operator and as a macro, then the
definition as a special operator should be set first.

\Defgeneric {fdefinition} {fname env}

This generic function is a generic version of the \commonlisp{}
function \texttt{cl:fdefinition}. 

If \textit{fname} has a definition in the function namespece of
\textit{env} (i.e., if \texttt{fboundp} returns true), then a call to
this function succeeds.  Otherwise an error of type
\texttt{undefined-function} is signaled.

If \textit{fname} is defined as an ordinary function or a generic
function, then a call to this function returns the associated
function object.

If \textit{fname} is defined as a macro, then a list of the form
\texttt{(cl:macro-function <function>)} is returned, where <function>
is the macro expansion function associated with the macro.

If \textit{fname} is defined as a special operator, then a list of the
form (\texttt{cl:special} <object>) is returned, where the nature of
<object> is currently not specified.

\Defgeneric {(setf fdefinition)} {new-def fname env}

This generic function is a generic version of the \commonlisp{}
function \texttt{cl:fdefinition}. 

\textit{new-def} must be a function.  If \textit{fname} already names
a function or a macro, then the previous definition is lost.  If
\textit{fname} already names a special operator, then an error is
signaled.

If \textit{fname} is a symbol and it has an associated setf
expander, then that setf expander is preserved.

\Defgeneric {macro-function} {symbol env}

This generic function is a generic version of the \commonlisp{}
function \texttt{cl:macro-function}.

If \textit{symbol} has a definition as a macro in \textit{env}, then the
corresponding macro expansion function is returned.

If \textit{symbol} has no definition in the function namespace of
\textit{env}, or if the definition is not a macro, then this
function returns \texttt{nil}.


\Defgeneric {(setf macro-function)} {new-def symbol env}

This generic function is a generic version of the \commonlisp{}
function \texttt{(setf cl:macro-function)}.

\textit{new-def} must be a macro expansion function or \texttt{nil}.
A call to this function then always succeeds.  A value of \texttt{nil}
means that the \textit{symbol} no longer has a macro function
associated with it.  If \textit{symbol} already names a macro or a
function, then the previous definition is lost.  If \textit{symbol}
already names a special operator, that definition is kept.

If \textit{symbol} already names a function, then any proclamation of
the type of that function is lost.  In other words, if at some later
point \textit{symbol} is again defined as a function, its proclaimed
type will be T.

If \textit{symbol} already names a function, then any INLINE or
NOTINLINE proclamation of the type of that function is lost.  In other
words, if at some later point \textit{symbol} is again defined as a
function, its proclaimed inline information will be \texttt{nil}.

If \textit{fname} is a symbol and it has an associated setf
expander, then that setf expander is preserved.

\Defgeneric {compiler-macro-function} {fname env}

This generic function is a generic version of the \commonlisp{}
function \texttt{cl:compiler-macro-function}.

If \textit{fname} has a definition as a compiler macro in
\textit{env}, then the corresponding compiler macro function is
returned.

If \textit{fname} has no definition as a compiler macro in
\textit{env}, then this function returns \texttt{nil}.

\Defgeneric {(setf compiler-macro-function)} {new-def fname env}

This generic function is a generic version of the \commonlisp{}
function \texttt{(setf cl:compiler-macro-function)}.

\textit{new-def} can be a compiler macro function or \texttt{nil}.
When it is a compiler macro function, then it establishes
\textit{new-def} as a compiler macro for \textit{fname} and any
existing definition is lost.  A value of \texttt{nil} means that
\textit{fname} no longer has a compiler macro associated with it in
\textit{env}.

\Defgeneric {function-type} {fname env}

This generic function returns the proclaimed type of the function
associated with \textit{fname} in \textit{env}.

If \textit{fname} is not associated with an ordinary function or a
generic function in \textit{env}, then an error is signaled.  

If \textit{fname} is associated with an ordinary function or a
generic function in \textit{env}, but no type proclamation for that
function has been made, then this generic function returns T.
