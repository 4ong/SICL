\section{Introduction}
\label{sec-introduction}

As we describe in our paper on bootstrapping
\cite{Durand-Strandh:2019:ELS:Bootstrapping}, after several phases of
creating metaobjects, the bootstrapping procedure results in a
collection of metaobjects that form an acyclic graph in that every
object in some first-class global environment is an instance of a
class defined in a preceding environment.  This graph must be turned
into a cyclic graph, as described by the AMOP book
\cite{Kiczales:1991:AMP:574212}, before the final system can be
created.

In this paper, we address a particular detail of this graph
transformation, namely how to make sure that every generic function
and its different effective method functions refer to other functions
that are guaranteed to be part of the same first-class global
environment as the generic function itself.  This property is a
prerequisite for generating the final code of a native \sicl{}
system. Other details of the graph transformation are fairly
straightforward, and involve just a modification of the class slot of
every metaobject.
