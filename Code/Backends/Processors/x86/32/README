The code in this directory is very likely obsolete, but there might be
snippets that we can use elsewhere.  For one thing, the x86-32 is not 
going to be a priority, so the code would have to be adapted to a more
modern backend.

Furthermore, the code in here relies on the code for a single
processor being loaded at one point in time.  That is not how we want
to organize things in the long run.  Instead, we plan to use generic
functions that specialize on the backend, so that several backends can
be in memory simultaneously.
