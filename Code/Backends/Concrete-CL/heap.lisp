;;; Heap management.
;;; 
;;; The heap is just a bunch of consecutive words.  We assume 
;;; a byte-addressed heap.  We also assume that when an address
;;; is used to fetch or store a word on the heap, then the 
;;; address is a multiple of the number of bytes in a word.  This
;;; assumption helps us debug problems where tagged objects are
;;; accidentally used as addresses.  
;;;
;;; At the moment, there is no garbage collection.  Allocation is
;;; done linearly from 0 and up.  

(defparameter *heap-pointer* 0)

;;; For debugging purposes, we remember the start address of 
;;; each allocation unit, so that we have some idea of the 
;;; frontiers between objects on the heap.
