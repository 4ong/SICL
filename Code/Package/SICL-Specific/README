There is a lot to be done in this directory:

 * It needs a file called condition-reporters-english.lisp in which
   definitions of condition reporters specific to this module are
   located.  It should be modeled after
   Cons/condition-reporters-english.lisp.

 * It needs a file called documentation-strings-english.lisp in which
   there should be documentation strings for the functions and classes
   defined in this module.  It should be modeled after
   Cons-high/docstrings-en.lisp

 * The current file functions.lisp should be split.  Each function and
   each macro should be in a separate file.  The files with function
   definitions should be called <mumble>-defun.lisp or
   <mumble>-defgeneric.lisp.  Similarly for macros and classes.

 * There are several FIXME comments in functions.lisp.  They should be
   taken care of accordingly.

 * Calls to ERROR should not have string arguments.  They should have
   the name of conditions defined in the file conditions.lisp.

 * Calls to ERROR should have restarts whenever there is a reasonable
   action to take in such a restart.  For example the error that
   signals NOT-A-PACKAGE-DESIGNATOR should have a restart for
   supplying a valid package designator.

 * Calls to ASSERT should be replaced by calls to ERROR with specific
   signals and they should also have associated restarts whenever
   reasonable.
