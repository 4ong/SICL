;;; Function (SETF MACRO-FUNCTION).
;;;
;;; The HyperSpec says that the consequences are undefined if a
;;; non-nil environment is given.  We define those consequences to be
;;; that an error is signaled.
;;;
;;; The HyperSpec further says that "Performing this operation causes
;;; symbol to have only that macro definition as its global function
;;; definition; any previous definition, whether as a macro or as a
;;; function, is lost."
;;;
;;; The HyperSpec also says that it is possible for a symbol to be
;;; defined both as a special operator and as a macro.  For that
;;; reason, we want to find out whether there is an entry that is
;;; either a global function entry or a global macro entry, but we
;;; want to ignore the possibility of there being a special operator
;;; entry.
