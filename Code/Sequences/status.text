What is done:

  find-if, find-if-not. (functions and compiler macros)
  Tests from Paul Dietz' ansi test suite for those functions

  find (function only). 

  position, position-if, position-if-not (functions only).

  length.
  Tests from Paul Dietz' ansi test suite for that function.

  reduce

  fill (function only).

How to test it:

  1. Load lisp-unit.lisp and sequences.asd into your lisp system.

  2. Run (asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op :sicl-sequences-test).

  3. Do (in-package #:sicl-sequences-test).

  4. Do a (run-tests)

What remains to to:

  Add tests that use APPLY and non-constant keyword arguments, so that
  we can test the functions find-if and find-if-not, and not the
  specialized versions created by the compiler macro.

  We need a subclass of the type-error condition, say
  not-a-proper-sequence that we can signal in case the sequence is
  not a proper sequence. 

  We also need a subclass of the type-error condition, say
  not-a-valid-sequence-index that we can signal in case some index is
  not a valid sequence index.  

  Add more sequence functions.

    find

      Write the compiler macro.
      Include the tests. 

    position, position-if, position-if-not

      Write the compiler macro.
      Include the tests.

    remove, remove-if, remove-if-not

      Special cases are as with find, find-if, and find-if-not plus
      that special versions for a :count of nil should be provided. 

      To remove things from a list when :from-end is t and :count is
      provided copy the elements to a new list in the reverse order,
      then traverse that list, while reversing the order and removing
      the elements. 

    delete, delete-if, delete-if-not

      Special cases are as with remove, remove-if, and remove-if not. 

      To delete elements from a list, keep a pointer to the preceding
      element, and bypass any cell containing an element to be
      deleted. 

      The difficult case is to delete from a list when :from-end is
      true and :count is given.  We might just give up in this case,
      and not modify the list at all. 

      If the sequence is a vector, just do the same thing that remove
      does. 

    copy-seq

      Nothing in particular here.  

    elt

      On a list, it is probably better to implement this using loop,
      as opposed to calling nth, because we might want to check that
      we have a proper list.

    fill

      Write the compiler macro.
      Include the tests.

    make-sequence

      I don't know how to do this portably at the moment.  The problem
      is that it is implementation-dependent what a recognizable
      subtype of (say) a vector is. 

    subseq

      Special version for the case where :end is not given or is nil. 

    map

      Same problem as make-sequence.

    map-into

      Provide special versions for 1 and 2 sequences, and for all 
      combinations of types of the sequences (including the resulting
      sequence). 

    count, count-if, count-if-not

      This is the only sequence function where it is specified that if
      :from-end is true, then the test must be applied from the end to
      the beginning. 

    reverse, nreverse 

      Nothing special.

    sort, stable-sort

      Use quicksort for sort and perhaps heapsort for stable-sort. 

    substite, substitute-if, substitute-if-not
    nsubstite, nsubstitute-if, nsubstitute-if-not

    search

      It is easy to do a quadratic version of this.  Is it possible to
      do better in the presence of arbitrary tests?  I suppose it
      would be possible to make a special version if sequence-1 is 
      constant, and the test is eql.  Then it should be possible to
      construct an automaton.  But is it worth it? 

    mismatch

    replace

      There is an interesting special case here, namely when the two
      sequences are the same, the regions overlap, and the target
      region is located after the source region.  In that case, one
      cannot copy from the beginning to the end.  It is possible to
      copy from the end to the beginning, but that might defeat the
      prefetch policiy of the cache.  If the two regions are
      sufficiently far apart, sub-regions of the size corresponding to
      the difference in start position could be copied from end to
      start, each sub-region being copied from start to end.  Again,
      is it worth it?  It might be, because this is actually used to
      implement gap-buffers used in things like Climacs. 

    concatenate

      Same problem as make-sequence

    merge

      Same problem as make-sequence


    remove-duplicates, delete-duplicates

      Special versions when the test is one for which we can portably 
      create a hash table, because then we can determine by looking in
      the hash table whether we have seen the element before.
