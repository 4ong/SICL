;;; The DEFCLASS macro.  The AMOP is inconsistent with respect to the
;;; CLHS.  For instance, it requires the arguments to ENSURE-CLASS to
;;; appear in the same order as they appear in the DEFCLASS form, but
;;; that should not matter since they are not evaluated.  Furthermore,
;;; the AMOP talks about additional class options, but no such
;;; additional options are permitted according to the CLHS.  We follow
;;; the CLHS.

;;; The AMOP says that the NAME argument to DEFCLASS becomes the first
;;; argument to ENSURE-CLASS.  Nothing particular here.
;;;
;;; The AMOP says that the DIRECT-SUPERCLASSES argument to DEFCLASS
;;; becomes the value of the :DIRECT-SUPERCLASSES argument to
;;; ENSURE-CLASS.  The CLHS requires that the DIRECT-SUPERCLASSES
;;; argument to DEFCLASS be a proper list of non-NIL symbols.
