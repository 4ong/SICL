;;;; This file contains the support code for the generic function
;;;; COMPUTE-EFFECTIVE-METHOD.
;;;;
;;;; In this file, there are no definitions of generic functions, nor
;;;; of any methods.  

;;;; This file contains an ordinary function that, given a list of
;;;; methods, computes an effective method using the standard method
;;;; combination.  This function is named
;;;; COMPUTE-EFFECTIVE-METHOD-DEFAULT.

;;; For the specification of this generic function, see
;;; http://metamodular.com/CLOS-MOP/compute-effective-method.html
;;;
;;; The specification includes a single method, specialized only for
;;; STANDARD-GENERIC-FUNCTION, independently of the method
;;; combination.  The default actions below is valid for
;;; STANDARD-GENERIC-FUNCTION and the STANDARD method combination. 

;;; In this version of COMPUTE-EFFECTIVE-METHOD-DEFAULT, we do not
;;; use the compiler to produce the effective method.  As a
;;; consequence, the effective method will contain loops that iterate
;;; over the different methods in each role. 
;;;
;;; For a version that DOES use the compiler, see the file
;;; compute-effective-method-support-a.lisp

;;; Notice that when the list of primary methods is empty, we do not
;;; signal an error.  Instead, we generate an effective method that
;;; signals an error.  The reason for doing it this way is that we
;;; might call COMPUTE-EFFECTIVE-METHOD in a situation other than when
;;; the generic function was invoked.  When COMPUTE-EFFECTIVE-METHOD
;;; is called as a result of an invocation of a generic function, it
;;; does not matter much whether we signal an error immediately, or
;;; generate an effective method that signals an error; the error will
;;; be signaled either way.  However, we sometimes employ a trick that
;;; we call SATIATING a generic function.  Satiating a generic
;;; function means simulating calls to it in order to fill up the
;;; cache and to create a discriminating function that does not have
;;; to call the full dispatch machinery very often.  For some
;;; simulated calls, it might be the case that there are only
;;; non-primary methods applicable.  But whether that is the case
;;; depends on the method combination of the generic function, so we
;;; can not make any assumptions about it; we can only call
;;; COMPUTE-EFFECTIVE-METHOD and use what it returns.  We certainly do
;;; not want to have an error signaled whenever there is a
;;; hypothetical future invocation of a generic function that might
;;; not have a primary method, so we delay the error signaling until
;;; this invocation actually happens.
