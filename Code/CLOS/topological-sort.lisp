;;; The algorithm implemented here is taken directly from this section
;;; in "Common Lisp, the Language, second edition":
;;; http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/html/cltl/clm/node274.html

;;; We extract the topological sorting code to a separate file that
;;; does not refer to any CLOS elements directly.  That way, this code
;;; can be executed by the host at bootstrapping time.  We are just
;;; given an object, presumably a class, and a function of one
;;; argument that takes that object and returns a list of other object
;;; (presumably classes) that are considered the direct superclasses
;;; of that class.  From that, we compute a class precedence list
;;; according to the rules specified in the section cited above.

;;; Recall from the section cited above that a "local precedence
;;; order" is a total ordering of a class C and its direct
;;; superclasses.  It takes the form (C C1 C2 ... Cn) where C is the
;;; class itself and C1, C2, ..., Cn are its direct superclasses in
;;; the order specified in the DEFCLASS form.  Notice that some class
;;; may be included in the local precedence order that is not
;;; explicitly mentioned in the DEFCLASS form.  In particular, if the
;;; metaclass is STANDARD-CLASS, then the class STANDARD-OBJECT is
;;; automatically a direct superclass, even though it is not
;;; explicitly mentioned in the DEFCLASS form.

;;; We define a "precedence relation" to be a set (represented as a
;;; list) if pairs (Ca . Cb).  Each pair encodes the "must precede"
;;; relation between two classes, Ca and Cb.  A "local precedence
;;; relation" is a precedence relation determined from the local
;;; precedence order as follows: Let (C C1 C2 ... Cn) be the local
;;; precedence order of the class C.  The local precedence relation is
;;; then computed as: ((C . C1) (C1 . C2) ... (Cn-1 . Cn))

;;; We define the "total precedence relation" of some class C to be
;;; the union of the local precedence relation of C and the local
;;; precedence relation of each of its (direct or indirect)
;;; superclasses.

;;; Given a local precedence order, compute the corresponding local
;;; precedence relation.
