;;; We do not want to use SLOT-BOUNDP and (SETF SLOT-VALUE) here.
;;; Given the name of a slot, those functions find a slot metaobject
;;; with that name, and then call the ...-USING-CLASS version of the
;;; function.  The main difficulty for those functions is to find the
;;; slot metaobject.  In SHARED-INITIALIZE, we already have the slot
;;; metaobject available, so we use the ...-USING-CLASS version
;;; directly.
