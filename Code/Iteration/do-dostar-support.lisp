;;; The name of this project is SICL, which doesn't stand for anything
;;; in particular.  Pronounce it like "sickle".
;;;
;;; The purpose of this code is to provide a totally portable
;;; implementation of some high-level functionality of the Common Lisp
;;; language, so that implementors of Common Lisp systems can
;;; integrate it as it is into their systems, without having to
;;; implement and maintain a specific version of it. 
;;;
;;; A portable implementation of the Common Lisp
;;; iteration macros.  
;;; 
;;; This implementation does not use any iteration construct, nor any
;;; operations on sequences (other than the ones we define ourself
;;; here).  Implementations can therefore load this file very early on
;;; in the bootstrap process.  It allows for operations on sequences
;;; and the loop macro to be defined in terms of the macros defined
;;; here.
