\chapter{Concrete Syntax Tree}

Most \commonlisp{} compilers assume that the input has been obtain by
an application of the \commonlisp{} \texttt{read} function to a
sequence of characters, which then returns a nest list structure that
serves as the input to the first pass of the compiler.

The first pass of \sysname{}, on the other hand, takes a
\emph{concrete syntax tree} (or \emph{CST} for short) as its input.  

A CST has the exact same structure as the corresponding tree
representing the source expression, except that some of the nodes in
the tree have been augmented with information on source location.

To obtain a CST from a sequence of characters, the most appropriate
technique is to use the external library
\texttt{concrete-syntax-tree}%
\footnote{https://github.com/s-expressionists/Eclector}
which does exactly that.
