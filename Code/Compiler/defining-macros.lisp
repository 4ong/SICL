;;; Macro DEFCONSTANT.
;;;
;;; The HyperSpec says that we have a choice as to whether the
;;; initial-value form is evaluated at compile-time, at load-time, or
;;; both, but that in either case, the compiler must recognize the
;;; name as a constant variable.  We have chosen to evaluate it both
;;; at compile-time and at load-time.  We evaluate it at compile time
;;; so that successive references to the variable can be replaced by
;;; the value.
;;;
;;; This is not the final version of the macro.  For one thing, we
;;; need to handle the optional DOCUMENTATION argument.

(defmacro defconstant (name initial-value &optional documentation)
  (declare (ignore documentation))
  `(eval-when (:compile-toplevel :load-toplevel :execute)
     (%defconstant ',name ,initial-value)))
