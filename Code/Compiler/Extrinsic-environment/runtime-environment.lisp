;;; Dynamic run-time environment.
;;;
;;; The dynamic run-time environment is a list of instances of the
;;; class DYNAMIC-ENVIRONMENT-ENTRY.
;;;
;;; In a native backend, the dynamic run-time environment would be
;;; passed in a register to each function, which is kind of like a
;;; hidden argument.  But in the extrinsic environment we do not want
;;; to add arguments to each function, because we want the
;;; function-call protocol to be compatible with that of the host, so
;;; that we can call host functions that ignore the existence of the
;;; target dynamic run-time environment.
;;;
;;; We solve this problem as follows: we define a host variable named
;;; *DYNAMIC-ENVIRONMENT* that holds the dynamic run-time environment
;;; of the target AROUND TARGET FUNCTION CALLS ONLY.  This host
;;; variable is SET (not bound) right before a function is called, and
;;; a lexical variable in the callee is bound to its value immediately
;;; upon function entry.  In a multi-threaded environment, this host
;;; variable must be BOUND for the duration of the thread so that each
;;; thread sees its own binding.

;;;
;;; The value of the variable *DYNAMIC-ENVIRONMENT* is only valid
;;; around function calls.  Each function has its own local variable
;;; containing the dynamic run-time environment as it needs it to be.
;;; That includes the function in which the UNWIND-PROTECT was
;;; executed.  Therefore the thunk stored in the UNWIND-PROTECT entry
;;; will be executed in the dynamic run-time environment of the
