\chapter{The \texttt{format} function}

The directory \texttt{Code/Format} contains a near-complete
implementation of the \texttt{format} function.  What is missing is
the printers for floating-point numbers.  Also, the \texttt{formatter}
function is not yet implemented.

We are planning to use the method created by Burger and Dybvig
for printing floating-point numbers.
