\chapter{Docstrings for all Common Lisp symbols}

As mentioned elsewhere, we believe that docstrings should be separate
from code, because they do not address the same audience.  In
addition, separating the two allows us to distribute the docstrings as
a separate module Many implementations have substandard docstrings, so
this is an important module that can be used as a drop-in replacement
for existing ones.

We will provide the infrastructure for allowing internationalization
of docstrings, but we probably will not provide different versions for
different languages.
