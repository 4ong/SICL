\sysname{} (which doesn't mean anything in particular; pronounce it
like ``sickle'') is a project with the purpose of creating a
collection of highly-portable high-performance ``modules'' for
developers of Common Lisp systems.  Such modules include ``standard
libraries'' such as high-level functions that operate on lists,
high-level functions that operate on sequences, the \texttt{format}
function, the \texttt{loop} macro, the \texttt{read} function, the
\emph{pretty printer}, etc.  Other modules include code that makes it
easier to write compilers, such as parsers of lambda lists, code for
manipulating declarations, etc.  Other planned modules include a
module that provides localized docstrings for all of Common Lisp.

We attempt to make the modules as portable as possible, and to
decrease interdependence as much as possible in order to make
bootstrapping easier, and to allow for modules to serve as drop-in
replacements in different implementations with as few modifications as
possible.  The lower layers use as few primitives as possible, without
sacrificing performance.  We think it is important that the code of
\sysname{} be of very high quality.  To that end, error messages
should be as explicit as possible.  Macros, for instance, do extensive
syntax analysis so as to prevent error messages from being phrased in
terms of expanded code.

To gain wide acceptance, \sysname{} is in the public domain, or is
distributed according to a license that serves the same purpose in
places where it is not possible for works to be explicitly placed in
the public domain.

Ultimately, this collection of modules might be used to produce a new
implementation of Common Lisp.  

We think it is possible to improve on existing open-source Common Lisp
systems in several ways, and we hope \sysname{} will be able to
accomplish that, provided that great care is taken to create code with
a combination of characteristics:

\begin{itemize}
\item The code is layered, so that different Common Lisp
  implementations can choose to include \sysname{} modules that
  represent gaps in their system or improvement on their existing
  code, without having to include parts for which they prefer their
  own, implementation-specific code. 

  Upper layers contain code that is not performance critical.  This
  code is written entirely in Common Lisp.  To avoid circular
  references, we specify what lower-level Common Lisp primitives can
  be used to write functions in the upper layer.  If done well, code
  in this layer could be used by all free Common Lisp implementations,
  which could save considerable maintenance effort.  Examples of
  functionality in this layer would be formatted output,
  pretty-printing, and macros that can expand to portable Common Lisp
  code.

  Intermediate layers contain code that needs careful tuning to
  obtain performance, but where the tuning can be handled by writing
  different versions of the code for different cases.  For instance,
  functions that work on all kinds of sequences might have special
  versions for lists and vectors.  Similarly, such functions might
  have special versions for common values of the \texttt{:test} (such
  as the Common Lisp functions \texttt{\#'eq}, \texttt{\#'eql}, etc.)
  and \texttt{:key} arguments (such as \texttt{\#'identity},
  \texttt{\#'car}, etc).  These special cases should be handled by
  using compiler macros.

  Lower layers have to rely more and more on implementation-specific
  details, and require the introduction of implementation-specific
  primitives to be used in implementations of standard Common Lisp
  constructs.  We might provide several different versions of code in
  this layer for different low-level assumptions.

\item The goal is for the code itself to be of very high quality.
  By this, we do not only mean that it should be bug-free as much as
  possible, but also that it should have good documentation strings
  and clear comments when required.  We want error messages to be as
  explicit as possible, and to accomplish that we try to capture as
  many exceptional situations as is possible without performance
  penalties.  We use very specific conditions that are subclasses of
  ones stipulated by the Common Lisp HyperSpec for condition
  signaling, so as to allow for implementations to take advantage of
  such specific conditions for better error reporting.  Macro
  expansion code should do everything possible to capture as many
  errors as possible so that error reporting can be done in terms of
  code written by the programmer, as opposed to in terms of expanded
  code.

\end{itemize}
