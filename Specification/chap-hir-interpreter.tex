\chapter{HIR interpreter}

This backend is characterized by the fact that source code is compiled
to the high-level intermediate representation (HIR).  The HIR code is
then interpreted by a \commonlisp{} program.  Recall that the
high-level intermediate code only manipulates \commonlisp{} objects so
that all address calculations are implicit.

At the center of this backend is a \sysname{} first-class global
environment represented as a host class instance.  This environment
contains mappings from names to all objects that are part of any
global environment, such as functions, macros, variables, classes,
packages, types, \texttt{setf} expanders, etc.
