\chapter{The \texttt{loop} macro} 

Our \texttt{loop} module will use all available Common Lisp functions
for its analysis of syntax and semantics.  We believe this is not a
problem, even though we assume the existence of \texttt{loop} for many
other modules, because the code in this module will be executed during
macro-expansion time, and for a new Common Lisp system, this would be
another full Common Lisp implementation. 

For systems without a full implementation of \texttt{loop} we are
planning to provide macro-expanded versions of modules that would
otherwise require \texttt{loop} in order to be compiled. 

Our \texttt{loop} module will use only standard Common Lisp code in
its expansion, so that macro-expanded uses of \texttt{loop} will not
require any other \sysname{} module in order to work.
