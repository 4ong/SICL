\chapter{Sequence functions}

This module provides high-performance implementations of the
functions in the ``sequences'' chapter of the HyperSpec.  High
performance will be obtained by identifying important special cases
such as the use of \texttt{:test} function \texttt{eq}, or
\texttt{equal}, or the use of a \texttt{:key} of \texttt{identity}. 

Compiler macros are supplied so as to avoid runtime dispatch
whenever a special-case function can be determined by only looking at
the call site.  This ensures high performance for short sequences,
where argument parsing would otherwise represent a significant
fraction of the cost of the call.

\section{Current state}

Code exists for most of the functions.  Compiler macros exist for some
of them.  Some functions can not be written portably; in particular
\texttt{make-sequence}, because it is implementation-dependent what a
recognizable subtype of (say) a vector is.

\section{Future work}

Concerning the \emph{sorting functions} (i.e., \texttt{sort} and
\texttt{stable-sort}) there is an interesting challenge with respect
to finding a stable sorting algorithm for vectors that uses little
extra space.  The naive version of mergesort uses $O(n)$ extra space,
but some research (\cite{Huang:1990:FSM:898863},
\cite{Huang:1988:PIM:42392.42403},
\cite{Katajainen:1996:PIM:642136.642138}) indicates that it is
possible to obtain an in-place stable version of mergesort.   Since
mergesort is typically significantly faster than quicksort, this would
be a worthwhile direction to pursue.
