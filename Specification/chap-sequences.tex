\chapter{Sequence functions}

This module will provide high-performance implementations of the
functions in the ``sequences'' chapter of the HyperSpec.  High
performance will be obtained by identifying important special cases
such as the use of \texttt{:test} function \texttt{eq}, or
\texttt{equal}, or the use of a \texttt{:key} of \texttt{identity}. 

Compiler macros will be supplied so as to avoid runtime dispatch
whenever a special-case function can be determined by only looking at
the call site.  This ensures high performance for short sequences,
where argument parsing would otherwise represent a significant
fraction of the cost of the call.
