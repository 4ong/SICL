\chapter{Array}
\label{chap-array}

There are a few things that can be done in a portable module for
arrays.  \texttt{array-total-size} and \texttt{array-dimensions} can
be defined in terms of \texttt{array-rank} and
\texttt{array-dimension}.  Furthermore, \texttt{aref} and
\texttt{(setf aref)} can be defined in terms of
\texttt{row-major-aref} and \texttt{(setf row-major-aref)}. 

It might be worthwhile defining a compiler macro for \texttt{aref}. 

At the moment, there is some experimental code for arrays in the
directory \texttt{Code/Array}, but it is probably best to do it over
from scratch.
